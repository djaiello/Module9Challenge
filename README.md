## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
The client wants more information about temperature trends before opening their surf shop. They want temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.  In addition they want two recommendations for further analysis pertaining to the business.


## Results

### Key differences in weather between June and December:
- The mean temperature in December (71.0) was almost 4 degrees colder than in June (74.9).
- The minimum temperature in December(56.0) was 8 degrees colder than in June (64.0).
- The maximum temperature in June(85.0) was only 2 degrees warmer than in December (83.0).

## Summary

   The results above show that on the island of Oahu, the temperature appears to be in favor of a surf and ice cream shop year-round.  Comparing between June and December, the average temperature only differs by 4 degrees, historically, with very comperable standard deviations.  This weather history appears to show room for many profitable days even in cold weather months. 

   In an effort to gather more data for this project, two additional queries for might include a June/December statistical analysis of the water temperature and a June/December statistical analysis of the wind speed and direction.  While the air temperature may remain relatively stable year-round, ocean currents may show large differences, affecting people's choice to swim/surf.  In addition, surfers are drawn to location by waves, which are generated and sustained by wind speed and proper direction.  More surfers, more surf shop sales and ice cream customers.
